Golden Ratio Facial Calculator
Golden Ratio Face Mesh
This project detects the golden ratio of facial features based on a mesh generated from a live webcam feed. It uses a blend of face detection and geometric analysis to calculate and display the ratio.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Mediapipe
NumPy
TensorFlow (if necessary for the facial feature analysis)
requests (for possible HTTP requests if needed)
You can install the dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy tensorflow requests
Description
This project leverages the power of OpenCV and Mediapipe to track facial features and calculate the golden ratio. The golden ratio is a mathematical ratio commonly found in nature, art, and architecture, often seen in human faces. The script takes a real-time webcam feed, processes the face mesh, and calculates the golden ratio using key facial landmarks.

How It Works
Face Mesh Generation: The program uses Mediapipe to create a 3D face mesh in real-time. It detects facial landmarks and generates a mesh structure that can be analyzed for measurements.

Golden Ratio Calculation: Key facial features are measured, and the ratio is calculated between distances on the face, such as between the eyes, nose, mouth, and chin. The ratio is then compared with the golden ratio value (~1.618) to assess how closely the face resembles the ideal proportion.

Results: The program outputs the golden ratio value for the face in real-time, allowing you to see how your face compares to the ideal proportions.

Setup and Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Golden-Ratio-Face-Mesh.git
cd Golden-Ratio-Face-Mesh
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python GR.py
Interact: The program will open a webcam feed. Once your face is detected, it will calculate the golden ratio of your facial features and display the result on the screen.
Example
Upon running the script, you'll see a webcam window with a mesh overlay on your face. The program will output the golden ratio based on the mesh. For instance, if the ratio is 3.7, this indicates the calculation of specific distances between facial landmarks, which are being compared against the ideal golden ratio.

Notes
Ensure your webcam is properly configured and accessible by OpenCV.
The golden ratio value may vary for different individuals, as the ideal golden ratio is an approximation.
The program uses a webcam feed, so make sure itâ€™s connected and functional before running the script.
The script provides real-time results, but it is recommended to have a stable environment for accurate measurements.
Troubleshooting
Permission Errors: If you encounter permission errors, consider running the script with elevated privileges or use the --user option when installing packages.
Mesh Not Showing: Ensure the mediapipe library is correctly installed and that your face is clearly visible in the webcam frame.
